                        <h1>Habits of Connection</h1>

                        <p>We’re that family. The ones who like running. We’ll run anywhere, the city, the forest or
                            even
                            on a treadmill. It’s something we’ve done since our college days and now our kids are
                            joining
                            the adventure and WE FREAKING LOVE IT. Luci, our 9-year-old, asked to run cross country last
                            year and we didn’t just say yes, we jumped on that horse and rode it into the sunset,
                            cheering
                            the whole way. It wasn’t because we want Luci to love running as we do, it’s because of the
                            opportunity a shared interest gives us to connect with her.</p>

                        <p>Connection with our kids (and any
                            other human) means feeling known. It’s where our hopes, fears, and thoughts are heard and
                            valued
                            by another. I believe it to be THE most powerful factor in our ability to positively impact
                            our
                            kids and for me, it all comes down to the habits of time, talk and touch. Cheesy, yes. Hard
                            to
                            forget, no.</p>

                        <h2>Time</h2>

                        <p> Connection requires time. Whether that’s finding a shared activity like cross-country or
                            snuggling in bed at night, I try to make sure I’m giving my kids time. There’s no task more
                            important than relationship. As they get older, I want a trusting connection with them so
                            conversations about ALL things (even the awkward sex stuff,) happen. This requires daily
                            investments. Connection trumps production…which sounds nice but can be exhausting. Finding
                            activities we all enjoy gives us an already established space. Does your family get jazzed
                            about
                            cooking? Then do it together! Enjoy biking? Then plan to ride a few times a week. Laundry
                            and
                            yardwork can even be leveraged! Use already created habits as time to connect.</p>

                        <div class="img-wrapper">
                            <img src="assets/images/static/article-thumb-2.jpg" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <h2>Talk</h2>


                        <p>And while time is good, it can be lacking unless I add talk. If you’re like me at least one
                            of
                            your kids never. stops. talking. which can make this step feel ridiculous. But conversation
                            is
                            different than a kid’s daily musings and becomes a necessary part of connection. It can be
                            easier to ask our kids for a daily report than talk about how these events made them think
                            about
                            or feel. These emotion and thought questions give my kids permission to share more deeply
                            while
                            giving me a glimpse of their heart and character. Feeling questions are the best conduit to
                            meaningful connection. They break through reciting “right” answers and invite my kids to
                            honest
                            sharing...which, no matter how ridiculous, I’ll take any day over false “correctness.”</p>

                        <h2>Touch</h2>

                        <p>So time and talk are helpful but the real key that'll seal the deal on all things connection
                            is touch. *Deep sigh for all the parents with babies who are touched out...you got this!*
                            Last week, Luci came in from a fun afternoon of play and we immediately noticed a horrible
                            smell following her...she freaking stunk. My sweet 9-year-old smelled like the captain of a
                            fishing boat and sadly, her Daddy didn’t handle it well. Franklin literally held his arm out
                            and like a football player, stiffed-armed her. Not his finest moment he later admitted. With
                            physical rejection, her emotional wall went up, hard. She backed away, rolled her eyes and
                            made a seething remark about how gross he often is. As she walked to the shower it was
                            apparent the trust connection had been damaged.</p>


                        <p>Countless research has shown how deeply important physical touch is for a kid's development.
                            It’s also shown how damaging withholding affection can be. Words carry weight but physical
                            assurance of love and care, create feelings of safety. Meaningful connection happens when
                            our kids believe their needs are met, physically AND emotionally.</p>


                        <p>When Luci came back from the much-needed shower, her heart was still hardened towards
                            Franklin. Everything he said was returned with a short and smart ass answer…until he walked
                            over and gave her a tight bear hug. I could see her physically relax in his arms. Touch
                            brought them back together and reminded her of his deep love. My kids need physical touch to
                            foster meaningful trust.</p>


                        <p>Time, talk and touch aren’t magical words but are powerful tools. They can be done all
                            together in a matter of minutes and have deep meaning and monumental impact. When I run with
                            Luci, it’s all of those things wrapped into one delicious relational burrito. We laugh, cry,
                            and gasp for air together. At the end of our time, we high-five and hug. Our hearts are for
                            one another and she believes she’s loved without measure. In those moments she listens to me
                            and I’ll never take for granted the gift of her soft heart. It’s a precious and sacred
                            connection that deserves to be stewarded well.</p>
